 LAB 1 -- C-style arrays, files, reference parameters

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 To run my included unit tests, you can type at the shell prompt:
 make test
 
 This command will compile both the files app.cpp and test.cpp
and then run the executable a.out

If you want to delete the executable to start again, you can type:
make clean

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 In class we saw code that reads a file line by line.

 In this lab, you will write functions to:
 - read a file word by word and populate an array of type string
 - sort the array of type string
 - print the array to a file 
 - a swap function that will be called by the sort function
 
 You may use any sorting algorithm that you would like. Selection sort from CISC 1115 will get full credit even though it is inefficient.
 
 Feel free to write your own main function to test your functions. However, please comment out
 your main function before submitting your code.
